# Linear Regression
## Overview
This project analyzes customer spending behavior for an online clothing store to determine whether the company should focus on improving its mobile app or desktop website. Customers visit the store for personal styling sessions and later make purchases online through one of these platforms. The analysis examines key factors influencing spending, including length of membership, time spent on the mobile app, and time spent on the website.

Findings reveal that mobile app usage has a strong correlation with spending, while time spent on the desktop website shows little to no impact. These insights suggest that prioritizing the mobile app experience could drive higher sales, whereas the desktop website may need improvements to enhance conversion rates.
